“I am deeply grateful to Cat for her meticulous and insightful work in revising and polishing my article. Her keen eye for detail, thoughtful suggestions, and commitment to clarity greatly enhanced the quality of the manuscript. Thanks to her expertise and dedication, the article was accepted by a prestigious academic journal. She is also such a great person to work with — I truly recommend her.”

“I especially thank my copyeditor, Cat Thomas. As a non-native speaker of English, I need a professional copyeditor like Cat for editing, clarifying, and polishing my language. Nevertheless, what Cat has done is more than copyediting. Literally being the first reader who read through the whole story, Cat would share her thoughts as a reader with me, especially based on her experiences on the issues of migrant workers in Taiwan. Moreover, Cat has been so encouraging for and confident with my writing, not only for the content per se but also for my personal tone in telling the story.”
